But a bit thin, no identifiable fruit flavor.","Sour, pear skin, a bit thin",6,"This coffee is kind of disappointing. I can appreciate how it lacks bitterness/faults and taste quite light.

It's not as light as I normally like, but I enjoy the roundness of the flavor, especially how tart it is.","Well rounded, tart and sweet, raspberry, toast",We're waking up after Courtney and martins wedding at the chabot space and science center! Grace and Sophie were in town but we got then sunburned and too drunk (respectively). Oops! Today is cloudy. We're having a relaxed morning before race training

Peach blossom and sticky sweet honey.,"""Techno peach"", Forrest grown",8,"Really nice breadth of flavors, I like it a lot, it hits at the beginning with fruity, then comes through with a spicy, then finishes with a latent fruit oil.","First taste is almost like a dulce de Leche, almost like a cardamum and clove, and then finish pomelo skin (sour bitter pithy).",7,"Got a lot better as it cooled. First sip was a six. Not full bodied but pretty balanced. Wish it were a bit fruitier, keeping it out of the top. Umami vibe.

Alex was sick this week and spread it to Rebecca who is now sick over the weekend and pissed. He also has been snoring loudly and Rebby had to sleep on the couch twice!!!

Luna,"Langley, British Columbia",,Honduras,Central America,Las Vegas - Santa Barbara,Benjamin Paz,M,Light,Honey,,,,4/17/22,Home,Rebecca,"creamy, dried blackcurrant, banana-bread, nutty finish",48hr honey process in sealed bags,8,I like it a lot. This is a really nice example of what I assume is some alternative process because it has a funky post fermented flavor. Very exciting and easy to appreciate the difference/contrast here,"Orange marmalade, red velvet cake, banana cream",8,"Truly 8.5. I like it a lot especially after it's cooled down. Super light. Sweet but I can't put my finger on it. Negatives are that it's not that fruity, a little watery","Carmel and buttery, strawberry shortcake, light! Slightly watery","Today we're recovering from our trail races, a little bit sore but generally doing well! Friday we went to a Seder dinner at Meghan and Perry's which was great.

Without much fruit flavor. The after taste is kind of bitter and herbaceous. Super unique.","Grape leaves, sumac, pickling spice",7,"Mixed feelings. Upfront flavor is pretty, round and full.

Unexpectedly mild for robusta. Kind of interesting to chase the dry process flavor through this. Not something I would seek out by itself. Rebby was right we shouldn't buy a bag.,Tastes like robusta but it also has redeeming qualities. Kind of a chai clove flavor. Cedar bark. There is a rindy flavor that could be considered as fruit!,3,"Tastes mostly like cheap dark roast coffee, argree wifh barista that it tastes like instant coffee. Maybr only slightly better. I would drink it and be fine, but if i was trying to identify good tastes, this isnt it. 7/11 coffee.","Burnt, acidic sour, caramel","San Jose day!

A very sophisticated coffee taster might be able to tease out some flavors, to me it's quite subtle. Maybe would be better with a little oat milk.","Sour yogurt, blueberry musk, black tea, acrid",5,"overall tastes too bitter and burned for me, in some ways has a kinda balanced flavor. aftertaste is very bitter. almost seems like a bad batch of a decent coffee, can tatse that its not just a super dark roast. has a balanced although not fruity or fine first taste, but turns off twoards the finish.","scortched earth, tree bark, touch of honey","Drinking the coffee in bed, about to go on a bike ride in Sonoma!

Philz,"San Francisco, CA",New Manhattan,,,,,,Light,Washed,,,,5/1/22,Out,Barista,"Citrus, Cherry, Floral",,4,"Consistent and pleasant. ""Pretty much what I expected"". Successfully avoided over roasted taste of second wave coffee while missing out on fruited/floral flavors that I would come to expect. Absolutely drinkable but in a different league of stuff we've been tasting.","Cucumber water, very mild, whole wheat graham cracker",5,"I'm sad, i feel like they gave us the wrong one, it doesn't taste like a light roast it tastes like a dark roast. Very mild pleasant flavor, but bitter aftertaste. Maybe if i had it compared to am actual dark coffee i would like it better, it might be too hot. After cooling I get more caramel and sweetness, bump from a 4 to a 5","Dirt, drip of caramel in the dirt, some tartness and cherry after cooling",In the car on the way to camping at Kirby Cove.

7 Eleven Reserve,"Dallas, Texas",7 Reserve,Guatemala,Central America,Huista,,,Medium,Washed,,1240,,5/1/22,Out,Batch Brewer,,,3,"Far better than expected, maybe it's fresh, expected overwhelmingly bitter and ashy. It's lighter and more sour and drinkable than expected.","Roasted barkamulch, fresh woody flavor, slightly soapy note, a little sour",3,Slightly worse than I expected.

Agree with Rebby that it's more an absence of issues than a stand out. Sourness and funk are some of my favorite parts of natural roast coffee. Better extraction might reveal more subtle flavors.,"Super sour, vitamin c pills, lemons sHerbert, aftertaste of Pennies",7,"I like it, first actual light roast in a while. Not as fruity as i would like but pleasant with a mild bitter aftertaste, nothing as bitter as the other ther coffees weve had recently.

Still rich in the mouth and still super bright, wish I could taste and smell more of the floral bouncy stuff and want to try again later","Tangerines and cuties, pomplemouse la croix, cinnamon bark",8,"Good, but notnquite as good as i was expecting. I dont think this js their best batch much better now that its cooled. Pretty flawless and has some good flavors, but missing some of the wow factors i was expecting.

I guess that's supposed to be full body. It's excellent, I wish it were fruitier but that's just a preference thing.","Fire roasted vegetables (carrots and broccolini over a grill), tartness, pleasant lasting bitterness",7,"Drinking it cooler, so advantaged.
